I'll give you money to go somewhere else. <br> <br> Let's see.. South Poles 'main attractions' : losing your nose to frostbite, ice fishing ( only for water banders ), staring into the empty desolate void made of ice and shuddering when it stares back.  <br> <br> Do you think Katara and Sokka went with Aang because it was the right thing to do? Nah they were straight up fleeing from this godforsaken place!",

Such beauty can be found here from old statues to breathtaking architecture, and you would not believe the view... <br> <br> Visiting old air nomad temples is important because it keeps their memory alive. The temples are a sad reminder of a great people wiped from existence for no good reason. Yeah it sounds depressing but i guess it should.",

It stands tall and proud and shields Ba Sing Se from every threat. <br> <br> Inside the walls you can see acres upon acres of farm lands streaching far and wide, in this area Lake Laogai can be found for some lake-side rest and relaxation and nothing ominous, but most poeple just take the train to the inner city as fast as they can - thats where the fun begins. <br> <br> In the inner city there are market places where you can buy the bast cabbages , tea shops, poetry reading clubs and many other attractions that can bankrupt your coin purse before the city urchins steal it! <br> <br> And in the very centre of the city a glorious palace resides, you can't really enter it but a glance from a distance is more than enough for a low-born scum like you, kidding kidding I'm sure you are not a peasant you're probably just having a bad day. Now then why are you still reading!? Come! Let Ba Sing Se show you why the Fire Nation fears it!",
